# Food-Order-React-app
In this app, user can add food to their cart. <br/><br/>
And the list shows all food which we want to add to our cart with number od items.<br/><br/>
Also describes about the food with its price.<br/><br/>
On Adding a food to the cart, the cart button is having a small animation and also updates the total item list number.<br/><br/>
And in the cart menu, user can change the quantity as well as remove the specific item.<br/><br/>
And also updates the final total price of the items.<br/><br/>
I have also create the form for the order details.<br/><br/>
Also used Firebase for the backend.<br/><br/>
